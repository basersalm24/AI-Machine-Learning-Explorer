    "title": "What are AI & Machine Learning?",
    "ai_term": "Artificial Intelligence (AI)",
    "ai_definition": "is a broad field of computer science dedicated to creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes things like learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. Think of it as the grand goal of making computers 'smart.'",
    "ml_term": "Machine Learning (ML)",
    "ml_definition": "is a powerful subset of AI. Instead of programming a computer with explicit rules to perform a task, ML involves developing algorithms that allow the computer to learn from data. It finds patterns, makes predictions, and improves its performance over time as it's exposed to more information. It's the engine that drives many of the AI applications we use today."
